## Introduction

The problem that the E-waste Facility Hub website is trying to solve is the improper disposal of e-waste in India. E-waste is a significant environmental and health hazard when not handled and disposed of properly. Here are some key aspects of the problem:
- Environmental Impact: Electronic waste contains hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can contaminate soil and water if not disposed of correctly. The improper disposal of e-waste contributes to pollution and environmental degradation.
- Health Concerns: E-waste often ends up in informal recycling operations, where workers are exposed to harmful substances during the dismantling and recycling process. This poses serious health risks to these individuals and nearby communities.
- Lack of Awareness: Many people in India may not be aware of the proper methods for disposing of e-waste or the potential environmental and health consequences of improper disposal.
- Resource Recovery: E-waste contains valuable resources, including rare metals and precious metals like gold, silver, and palladium. When e-waste is improperly disposed of, these resources are lost.
- Job Security: The informal e-waste recycling sector can be hazardous, and many of the workers involved are vulnerable and may not have job security. Creating a link between e-waste facilities and local artisans can provide job security and safer working conditions.
